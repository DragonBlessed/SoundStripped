# SoundStripped

The SoundStripped project is a project to build an extension or application that is accessible
through desktop or web browser. The project is going to be coded using Javascript, CSS,
and HTML. It can allow users to eliminate video from audio with the click of a
button. Great for song videos/playlists.
